### Hey there 👋

I'm Jan, a freelance web developer from Slovenia and currently a student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://feri.um.si/en/).

I mostly work on backend jobs, but in my free time I fiddle around with various side projects. Some of which are publicly available right here on my GitHub profile.
